Repeating the query doesn't change the underlying network problem.  I'm unable to access the necessary resources to provide information about dreams.  You *must* address the network connectivity issue.  Here are the steps to try again, and some additional things to consider:\n\n* **Check Internet Connection (Again):**  Use a different device on the same network to see if it can connect.  This helps isolate if the problem is with your device or the network itself.\n* **DNS Server (Again):** If you've already tried changing DNS servers, try a different one.  There are many public DNS servers available.\n* **Firewall/Proxy (Again):**  If you suspect a firewall, check its configuration carefully for any rules blocking outgoing connections.\n* **System Time (Again):**  Double-check that the system time, including the time zone, is correct.\n* **Restart (Again):**  Sometimes a second restart helps.\n* **Network Cables/Wireless Signal:**  Check for loose or damaged network cables if you're using a wired connection.  If on Wi-Fi, move closer to the router to improve signal strength.\n* **VPN:** If you're using a VPN, try disconnecting it temporarily.  The VPN could be the source of the problem.\n* **Contact Your ISP:** If you've tried all these steps and still can't connect, contact your Internet Service Provider. There might be an outage in your area.\n\n\nFix the network problem first.  Until then, I won't be able to respond to any queries that require internet access.\n"}
